# Visu*all* User Guide

This guide shows how Visu*all* sample application can be used to analyze movie dataset available in this application. This sample app assumes a Neo4j databasase installed on a server side with free and openly available movie dataset. The client side on the other hand is a web page with main components of a menubar and a toolbar on top, a drawing canvas to show relations as a graph / map and a collection of panels on the right.

Visu*all* uses [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) and many of [its extensions](https://js.cytoscape.org/#extensions) to provide a drawing canvas, where relations among various movies and people involved can be visualized and further inspected. Hence, many of the capabilities of Visu*all* is inherited from Cytoscape.js, including pan, zoom, drag, navigator window, context menus, automatic layout, etc.
