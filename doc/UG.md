# Visu*all* User Guide

This guide shows how Visu*all* sample application can be used to analyze movie dataset available in this application. This sample app assumes a Neo4j databasase installed on a server side with free and openly available movie dataset. The client side on the other hand is a web page with main components of a menubar and a toolbar on top, a drawing canvas to show relations as a graph and a collection of panels on the right.
